                                    <p>"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude." - Fifteenth Amendment</p>
                                </div>
								
								<p>But in order to prevent African-Americans from becoming a political threat, they were not allowed to vote. As a result, they had no say in what officials were elected. When discriminatory laws were approved by the Supreme Court, such as Williams v. Mississippi, in which African-Americans were barred from voting, these laws spread through the South quickly. According to the Civil Rights Foundation, Given the green light, Southern states began to limit the voting right to those who owned property or could read well, to those whose grandfathers had been able to vote, to those with ‘good characters,’ to those who paid poll taxes. In 1896, Louisiana had 130,334 registered black voters. Eight years later, only 1,342, one percent, could pass the state’s new rules.</p>

								<p>This left white voters in control, which was essential for them to maintain white political dominance. There were several ways that prevented African-Americans from being able to vote.</p>
								
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Former prisoners: Individuals who had gone to prison were not able to vote. During this time African-American’s were often arrested falsely, or on minor offenses. Prisons provided cheap labor to keep the Southern states economy afloat.</li>
                                    <li>Grandfather clause: People who could not read and owned no property were exempt from educational, property, or tax requirements for voting if their fathers or grandfathers had voted before 1867. Of course, practically no blacks could vote before 1867, just two years after slaves were freed.</li>
                                    <li>Literacy test: Most illiterate people were not allowed to vote. A few were allowed if they could understand what was read to them. The literacy tests varied from state to state. But they often included trivia questions related to civic procedure and citizenship and sometimes even trick questions. Even if an African-American was able to pass the test, they still were not able to vote. </li>
                                    <li>Poll taxes: In Southern states, people had to pay a tax in order to vote. Many people had low incomes and could not afford this tax. In some southern states poor southern whites could bypass the poll taxes due to the Grandfather clause.</li>
                                    <li>Property: Many states only allowed property owners to vote. During this time many African-Americans did not own property, some states even restricted the type of property that African-Americans can own.</li>
                                    <li>Purges: Some white officials removed names off of the official lists of registered voters.</li>
                                    <li>Violence: African-American’s who tried to vote were threatened, arrested, attacked, and some were even killed. Some of their families were harmed, their homes were burned down, and their jobs were threatened if they tried to vote.</li>
                                </ol>
								
								<div class="box">
                                    <p>"The tax collector shall keep a separate account of the amount of the poll taxes paid by persons, of each race in each township or separate school district." - Alabama, 1935</p>

								<p>Still, former felons, which account for 6.1 million people in 2016, are not allowed to vote in most states. 1 of every 13 African Americans of voting age is disenfranchised, a rate more than four times greater than non-African Americans. There are also restrictions on those who are currently serving sentences or on parole or probation. Purging is also another method still used today that affect people of color. Any registered voter in the state can challenge another voter’s registration. These voters are notified via mail and must appear at a county board of elections or return a notarized form in order to maintain their ability to vote. </p>

                                </span>

								<p>Although most the methods that were used to prevent African-Americans to vote are no longer in place there are now news laws that still put a burden on eligible voters. Cuts to early voting, voter ID laws and purges of voter rolls make it harder for African-Americans, as well as students, people with disabilities and the elderly to vote.</p>
								
                                <p>The voter ID laws are similar to the poll tax laws that were in place. Many people of color, especially those of fixed incomes do not have transportation needed to travel to special offices where they can get a government-issued ID. A birth certificate, which can cost anywhere from $10 to $45 is also another additional expense. The housing crisis also left many minorities and poor families unable to claim permanent residency to get a voter ID. In the 2016 presidential election up to 17 states that are home to over 110 million people and account for 189 out of the 270 electoral votes have restrictive voting laws in place.</p>
