								<h3>Then</h3>
								<p>As a result of the need to reinforce and restore racial boundaries whites picked out African American’s to harass them. White intimidation from individuals and organizations such as the Ku Klux Klan could threaten, beat, torture, rape and kill African-American’s without fear of persecution.</p>

								<p>Vestibulum ultrices risus velit, sit amet blandit massa auctor sit amet. Sed eu lectus sem. Phasellus in odio at ipsum porttitor mollis id vel diam. Praesent sit amet posuere risus, eu faucibus lectus. Vivamus ex ligula, tempus pulvinar ipsum in, auctor porta quam. Proin nec dui cursus, posuere dui eget interdum. Fusce lectus magna, sagittis at facilisis vitae, pellentesque at etiam. Quisque posuere leo quis sem commodo, vel scelerisque nisi scelerisque. Suspendisse id quam vel tortor tincidunt suscipit. Nullam auctor orci eu dolor consectetur, interdum ullamcorper ante tincidunt. Mauris felis nec felis elementum varius.</p>

								<h3>Now</h3>
								<p>Policies and practices at the federal, state, and local levels continue to disproportionately burden racial and ethnic minorities. Minorities are unfairly victimized by racial profiling. People of color are profiled while they drive, shop, pray, stand on the sidewalk waiting for work, or travel on airplanes, trains, and buses.</p>

								<p>In a 2011 study conducted by The Opportunity Agenda, Media Representations & Impact on the Lives of Black Men and Boys, negative mass media portrayals were strongly linked with lower life expectations among black men. Negative associations such as crime, unemployment, and poverty are often exaggerated.These portrayals, constantly reinforced in media, shape public views of and attitudes toward men of color with lack of sympathy.</p>
								
                                <p>A majority of blacks (71%) say that they have experienced discrimination or been treated unfairly because of their race or ethnicity. Roughly one-in-ten (11%) say this happens to them on a regular basis, while 60% say they have experienced this rarely or from time to time. Blacks with at least some college experience (81%) are much more likely than blacks who never attended college (59%) to say they have been discriminated against because of their race. Four-in-ten blacks say their race has made it harder for them to succeed in life. Roughly half (51%) say their race hasn’t made a difference in their overall success, and just 8% say being black has made things easier.</p>
