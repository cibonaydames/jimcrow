								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								
								<p>From slavery to Jim Crow and beyond the Civil Rights Era, this could be one take on the history of African-Americans in the United States. Tragedies and triumphs, marked by injustice and overcoming adversity despite incredible odds, African-American history is a rich history. For many reasons the attempt to fully explore it and its effects in a robust and inclusive way is still ongoing. Jim Crow was a way of life to make sure that whites maintained superiority over African-Americans through segregation laws, customs, and attitudes.</p>
								
								<blockquote>“You cannot have a race in which one runner is loaded down with weights and chains for half the race, remove them, and suggest that from then on it’s a fair contest.” - Michael Tanner, Cato Institute senior fellow</blockquote>
								
								<p>However, what legacy has Jim Crow left on us? This site was created to explore this history and connect to current events. In order to uplift and improve the African-American community, there must be a cultural shift that creates consciousness and social action. This cultural shift begins with dialogue, and the dialogue starts here.</p>

                                    <blockquote>“He would put on not only blackface makeup, but shabby dress that imitated in his mind—and white people’s minds of the time—the dress and aspect and demeanor of the southern enslaved black person.” - Eric Lott, author of <i>Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class</i>.</blockquote>

                                <p>The popularity of Jump Jim Crow and the minstrel shows as entertainment caused many whites to refer to most African American males as Jim Crow. It wasn’t just to point out his or her skin complexion, it was to belittle that person and reflect the dumb, lazy, and sneaky caricature that Rice performed.</p>

                            <h2>Jim Crow</h2>
                            <p>Between 1877 and 1954, Jim Crow became a way of life that signified the segregation of African Americans to lesser, separate facilities from whites over four generations. The Jim Crow Laws were enforced and disenfranchised African-Americans economically, politically, legally, socially, and personally, which broaden the reach of the Black Codes and thus made them second class citizens. </p>

                                        <p>“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”- Fourteenth Amendment</p>

                                <p>In 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that “separate but equal” accommodations African Americans were permitted under the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment “could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political equality, or a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either.”</p>

								    <span class="image right"><img src="images/H-StreetCar_Terminal.jpg" alt="" />
                                        <p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:1.25em; color:#8E8892"><i>Negro drinking at "Colored" water cooler in streetcar terminal, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 1939</i></p> 
                                    </span>
								<p>Under Jim Crow, public venues such as water fountains, restrooms, bus waiting areas, movie theaters, swimming pools, and public schools were segregated. Private restaurants, restrooms, hospitals, churches, libraries, schoolbooks, waiting rooms, housing, prisons, cemeteries, and asylums also had “whites only” and “colored” signs. However, most “colored” facilities were older, poorly maintained, and less resources even if there was a facility available. Exclusion from white society forced African Americans to build their own communities. The Jim Crow laws also affected social relations. African Americans and whites could not marry by law, or socialize by custom.</p>

								<p>African Americans who violated Jim Crow norms risked their homes, their jobs, and even their lives. They could be arrested, attacked, or worse killed. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, between 1877 and 1950, 3,959 black men, women and children were lynched, captured, and viciously murdered by mobs. Most of the lynch victims were hung or shot, but some were burned at the stake, castrated, beaten, or dismembered. Since the laws and customs were different from place to place, it made it difficult for African American’s to know the local social customs. Many times, newspapers would advertise upcoming hangings. African Americans did not have many legal options against these assaults because the police, prosecutors, judges, juries, and prison officials were all white.</p>
								
								<h3>The End is Near</h3>
								
								<p>In 1954, Brown v. Board of Education outlawed racial segregation in public schools arguing that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” Brown opened the door to formally address other forms of racial inequity and integrate public facilities. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, helped fight racial discrimination by banning segregation in public places and outlawing discriminatory voting practices that prevented African Americans from voting. However, changing these laws did not change customs. De facto segregation, segregation by custom rather than by law - is still with us.</p>

								<h2>A Deeper Look Into the Jim Crow South</h2>
								<p>In the years immediately following Brown v. Board, five Southern legislatures passed almost fifty new Jim Crow laws. The Ku Klux Klan terrorized locals and bombed the homes and churches of African-Americans. Civil right leaders, activists, and local communities organized boycotts, marches, and sit-ins. The outcome of these protests and demonstrations, which fought for equality became violent.</p>

                                <p>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. considered Birmingham, Alabama, on of the most segregated cities in the United States, in the 1960’s. Even though the city’s population was 60% white and 40% African-American, there were no African-American police officers, firefighters, sale associates, bus drivers, or bank tellers. The unemployment rate for African-Americans was two and a half times higher than whites, and their income was half. Moreover, only 10% of the African-American population was registered to vote.</p>

                            <p>The Birmingham Campaign was a movement led in early 1963 by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) who hoped to bring national attention of the efforts of local African-American leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Reverends James Bevel, and Fred Shuttlesworth to desegregate public facilities in Birmingham, Alabama. This campaign was a model of nonviolent protests, and with the media, drew attention to racial segregation in the South. Eventually, this led to the city’s government to change discriminatory laws and helped with the writing and passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</p>
