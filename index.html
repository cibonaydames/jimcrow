								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								
								<p>From slavery to Jim Crow and beyond the Civil Rights Era, this could be one take on the history of African-Americans in the United States. Tragedies and triumphs, marked by injustice and overcoming adversity despite incredible odds, African-American history is a rich history. For many reasons the attempt to fully explore it and it’s effects in a robust and inclusive way is still ongoing. Jim Crow was a way of life to ensure that white’s maintained superiority over African-American’s through segregation laws, customs, and attitudes.</p>
								
								<blockquote>“You cannot have a race in which one runner is loaded down with weights and chains for half the race, remove them, and suggest that from then on it’s a fair contest.” - Michael Tanner, Cato Institute senior fellow</blockquote>
								
								<p>But, what legacy has Jim Crow left on us? This site was created to explore this history and tie it with current events. In order to uplift and improve the African-American community, there must be a cultural shift in order to create consciousness and social action. This cultural shift begins with dialogue and the dialogue starts here.</p>

                                    <p>In 1828, a white entertainer in New York by the name of Thomas Dartmouth “Daddy” Rice danced and sang mocking an African-American slave, the act was called “Jump Jim Crow”. His performance became a huge hit across the country and initiated a new form of American popular culture through music and theatrical performance.</p>

                                    <blockquote>“He would put on not only blackface makeup, but shabby dress that imitated in his mind—and white people’s minds of the time—the dress and aspect and demeanor of the southern enslaved black person.” - Eric Lott, author of <i>Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class</i>.</blockquote>
                                </div>

                                <p>The popularity of Jump Jim Crow and the minstrel shows as entertainment caused many whites to refer to most African American males as Jim Crow. It wasn’t just to point out his or her skin complexion, it was to belittle that person and reflect the dumb, lazy, and sneaky caricature that Rice performed.</p>

                                    <p>In 1865, during the Reconstruction era the Thirteenth Amendment outlawed slavery, but African Americans still faced many obstacles. </p>

                            <p>White southerners in former Confederate states felt threatened by African-Americans who wanted equality and thus established “black codes.” These laws were designed to restrict freed slaves activities and ensure that they could still be used as a labor force by requiring them to accept unfavorable work contracts. African-Americans could not own property, conduct business, own or lease land, and vote or bear arms.</p>

                            <p>Towards the end of the Reconstruction period, the South continued to disfranchise African Americans through legal means by reestablishing many of the black codes into “Jim Crow laws.”</p>

                            <h2>Jim Crow</h2>
                            <p>Between 1877 and 1954, Jim Crow became a way of life that signified the segregation of African Americans to lesser, separate facilities from whites over four generations. The Jim Crow Laws were enforced and disenfranchised African-Americans economically, politically, legally, socially, and personally, which broaden the reach of the Black Codes and thus made them second class citizens. </p>

                                    <p>In 1892, Plessy boarded a "whites-only" compartment on a train, and was arrested after he refused to move to a "colored" compartment when told to do so. He argued this violated the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

                                    <div class="box">
                                        <p>“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”- Fourteenth Amendment</p>

                                <p>In 1896, the U.S. Supreme Court determined that “separate but equal” accommodations African Americans were permitted under the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment “could not have been intended to abolish distinctions based upon color, or to enforce social, as distinguished from political equality, or a commingling of the two races upon terms unsatisfactory to either.”</p>

								<span class="image right"><img src="images/StreetCar_Terminal.jpg" alt="" />
                                        <p style="font-size:12pt; line-height:1.25em; color:#8E8892"><i>Negro drinking at "Colored" water cooler in streetcar terminal, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 1939</i></p>  
                                    </span>
								<p>Under Jim Crow, public venues such as water fountains, restrooms, bus waiting areas, movie theaters, swimming pools, and public schools were segregated. Private restaurants, restrooms, hospitals, churches, libraries, schoolbooks, waiting rooms, housing, prisons, cemeteries, and asylums also had “whites only” and “colored” signs. However, most “colored” facilities were older, poorly maintained, and less resources even if there was a facility available. Exclusion from white society forced African Americans to build their own communities. The Jim Crow laws also affected social relations. African Americans and whites could not marry by law, or socialize by custom.</p>

								<p>African Americans who violated Jim Crow norms risked their homes, their jobs, and even their lives. They could be arrested, attacked, or worse killed. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, between 1877 and 1950, 3,959 black men, women and children were lynched, captured, and viciously murdered by mobs. Most of the lynch victims were hung or shot, but some were burned at the stake, castrated, beaten, or dismembered. Since the laws and customs were different from place to place, it made it difficult for African American’s to know the local social customs. Many times, newspapers would advertise upcoming hangings. African Americans did not have many legal options against these assaults because the police, prosecutors, judges, juries, and prison officials were all white.</p>
								
								<h3>The End is Near</h3>
								<p>In 1954, Brown v. Board of Education outlawed racial segregation in public schools arguing that “separate educational facilities are inherently unequal.” Brown opened the door to formally address other forms of racial inequity and integrate public facilities. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, helped fight racial discrimination by banning segregation in public places and outlawing discriminatory voting practices that prevented African Americans from voting. However, changing these laws did not change customs. De facto segregation, segregation by custom rather than by law - is still with us.</p>
